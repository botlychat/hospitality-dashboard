### 3. ❓ "I think the profile button is different in each file, should we make a new file for profile?"

**Answer:** ✅ **YES! Absolutely!** 

#### Profile Button Variations Found:

We found **3 DIFFERENT** profile button implementations!

##### Variation A: dashboard.html & index.html
```css
.profile-menu {
  border-radius: 8px;
  min-width: 180px;
  z-index: 1000;
  overflow: visible;  /* ← Different */
}
```

##### Variation B: units.html & website.html
```css
.profile-menu {
  border-radius: 10px;  /* ← Different */
  min-width: 190px;     /* ← Different */
  z-index: (not set);
  overflow: hidden;     /* ← Different */
}
```

##### Variation C: contacts.html & aiagent.html
```css
.profile-menu {
  border-radius: 8px;
  min-width: 180px;
  z-index: 10;          /* ← Different */
  overflow: hidden;     /* ← Different */
  font-size: 13px;      /* ← Different */
}
```

**Problem:** Profile button looks/behaves differently on each page! 😞

## 🚀 Implementation Paths

### Option A: Automated Cleanup (RECOMMENDED)
```
Say: "Yes, automate the cleanup!"
↓
I will automatically:
  ✅ Remove all <style> blocks from 6 HTML files
  ✅ Remove all <script> blocks from 6 HTML files
  ✅ Add correct <link> tags to all files
  ✅ Add correct <script> tags to all files
  ✅ Verify all changes
Time: ~5 minutes
Risk: Minimal (can revert with git)
```

### Option B: Manual Cleanup with Guidance
```
Say: "Guide me through it manually"
↓
I will provide:
  ✅ Step-by-step instructions for each file
  ✅ Exact code to remove (copy-paste)
  ✅ Exact code to replace (copy-paste)
  ✅ Verification checklist
Time: ~30 minutes
Risk: Minimal (you control each change)
```

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
```
You manually edit a few files, I automate the rest
↓
Best of both worlds
Time: ~15 minutes
Risk: Minimal
```
