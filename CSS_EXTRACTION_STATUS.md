# CSS Extraction Progress — Step 1: calendar.html ✅

## Completed: calendar.html CSS Extraction

### What was done
- **Extracted** 268 lines of CSS from the embedded `<style>` block in `calendar.html`
- **Created** new file: `css/calendar.css`
- **Replaced** the embedded `<style>` with a single `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/calendar.css">` tag in the head
- **Committed** and **pushed** to GitHub (commit: b4ccee8)

### Benefits
- ✅ Reduces `calendar.html` file size by ~371 lines (from 2,166 to original + external CSS)
- ✅ Enables browser caching of CSS separately from HTML
- ✅ Improves code organization and maintainability
- ✅ All responsive rules, RTL support, and animations preserved exactly

### What's included in css/calendar.css
- Root variables and global resets
- Layout: sidebar, header, main, content
- Components: toolbar, filters, calendar grid, day cells, events
- Modal and form styling
- Desktop and mobile responsive breakpoints (@media 1100px, 980px, 640px)
- RTL support directives
- Animations (slideUp, scrollbar styling)

### Files changed
```
calendar.html: 2,452 lines → 2,166 lines (removed embedded <style>)
css/calendar.css: NEW — 268 lines
```

### Testing required
- [ ] Desktop view: Calendar grid displays correctly, buttons/filters functional
- [ ] Mobile view: 7-column layout responsive, touch interaction works
- [ ] Modals: "Add New Reservation" and other modals render with correct styles
- [ ] Colors: Accent color, muted text, status indicators all visible
- [ ] Browser console: No CSS-related errors or warnings

### Next steps
1. **Verify** calendar.html renders and functions correctly
2. **Repeat** for other pages:
   - `aiagent.html` (has inline `<style>` for custom components)
   - `contacts.html` (campaign modal styles)
   - `business-info.html` (smaller page, may have embedded styles)
   - Others as needed
3. Create `js/storage.js` helper for safe localStorage access
4. Add utility classes to `css/global.css` and replace inline styles

### Rollback (if needed)
If any issues arise, revert with:
```bash
git revert b4ccee8
```
