## Key Decisions Made

### ✅ Framework: Vue 3
**Why not React?** React is more complex and overkill for admin dashboards
**Why not Svelte?** Svelte has smaller ecosystem and less job market demand

### ✅ Build Tool: Vite
**Why not Webpack?** Webpack is slower and more complex than Vite
**Why not Parcel?** Parcel is good but Vite is more optimized for Vue

### ✅ Deployment: GitHub Pages
**Why not Vercel?** GitHub Pages is free and already working; Vite SPA builds work perfectly
**Why not Netlify?** Netlify adds unnecessary complexity for this use case

---

## Project Status

### ✅ Completed
- Refactored all 8 HTML files to use Storage helper (55+ localStorage calls replaced)
- Extracted CSS into 9 modular files (no duplication)
- Documented entire codebase
- Created comprehensive SPA migration guides

### 🔄 In Progress
- Framework decision: **Vue 3 + Vite RECOMMENDED**

### ⏳ Next Steps
1. Create Vite + Vue project
2. Convert components week by week
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Optional: Add Vue Router
