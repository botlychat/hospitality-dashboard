# 🌐 Clean URLs Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide shows how to implement clean URLs (removing `.html` extensions) for your hospitality dashboard so that:
- `website.com/calendar.html` becomes `website.com/calendar`
- `website.com/dashboard.html` becomes `website.com/dashboard`
- etc.

---

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Clean URL Files Created ✅
```
✅ /dashboard    (copy of dashboard.html)
✅ /calendar     (copy of calendar.html)  
✅ /units        (copy of units.html)
✅ /contacts     (copy of contacts.html)
✅ /website      (copy of website.html)
✅ /aiagent      (copy of aiagent.html)
```

### 2. Updated Navigation Function ✅
- Modified `js/utils.js` → `getPagePath()` function
- Now automatically removes `.html` extensions
- Works with both GitHub Pages and local development

### 3. Server Configuration Files Created ✅
- `.htaccess` for Apache servers
- `_config.yml` for GitHub Pages Jekyll
- PowerShell build script for local development

---

## 🎯 Implementation Methods

### Method 1: GitHub Pages (Current Setup) ⭐ **Active**

**How it works:**
- Created duplicate files without `.html` extension
- Files `/dashboard`, `/calendar`, etc. are exact copies
- URLs work immediately: `yoursite.com/dashboard`

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works immediately on GitHub Pages
- ✅ No server configuration needed
- ✅ Backward compatible (old URLs still work)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ File duplication (managed automatically)

### Method 2: Apache Server (.htaccess)

If you deploy to Apache server, use the `.htaccess` file:

```apache
# Remove .html extension from URLs
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ $1.html [NC,L]

# Redirect .html URLs to clean URLs
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\.html [NC]
RewriteRule ^ /%1? [NC,L,R=301]
```

### Method 3: Nginx Server

For Nginx servers, add to your config:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;
}

# Redirect .html to clean URLs
location ~ \.html$ {
    return 301 $scheme://$server_name$uri;
}
```

| `/units.html` | `/units` | ✅ Active |
| `/contacts.html` | `/contacts` | ✅ Active |
| `/website.html` | `/website` | ✅ Active |

## 🔧 How Navigation Works Now

### Updated `getPagePath()` Function:
```javascript
function getPagePath(filename) {
  const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
  
  // Remove .html extension for clean URLs
  const cleanFilename = filename.replace(/\.html$/, '');
  
  // Check if we're on GitHub Pages
  if (currentPath.includes('/hospitality-dashboard/')) {
    return '/hospitality-dashboard/' + cleanFilename;
  }
  // Local development
  return cleanFilename;
}
```

### Example Usage:
```javascript
// Old way (still works):
navigateToPage('dashboard.html');

// New way (preferred):
navigateToPage('dashboard');

// Both result in clean URL: website.com/dashboard
```

## 🚀 Testing Your Clean URLs

### Local Testing:
1. Open your local server
2. Navigate to: `localhost:8000/dashboard`
3. Should work without `.html` extension

### GitHub Pages Testing:
1. Visit your GitHub Pages URL
2. Try: `yourusername.github.io/hospitality-dashboard/dashboard`
3. Should load the dashboard page

### All Clean URLs to Test:
```
✅ /dashboard     - Main dashboard
✅ /calendar      - Calendar view  
✅ /units         - Units management
✅ /contacts      - Contacts management
✅ /website       - Website settings
✅ /aiagent       - AI Agent configuration
```

## 📝 Maintenance

### When Adding New Pages:
1. Create the HTML file (e.g., `newpage.html`)
2. Create clean URL copy: `Copy-Item "newpage.html" "newpage"`
3. Update navigation if needed

### Automated Maintenance:
Use the provided PowerShell script:
```powershell
# Run when you add new HTML files
.\build-clean-urls.ps1
```

## 🔍 SEO Benefits

### Before (with .html):
```
❌ website.com/dashboard.html
❌ website.com/calendar.html
❌ Looks technical/dated

```
✅ website.com/dashboard
✅ website.com/calendar  
✅ Professional appearance
✅ Shorter, memorable URLs
✅ Better for sharing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Clean URL shows 404
**Solution:**

- Verify server supports clean URLs
- For Apache: ensure `.htaccess` is uploaded

### Problem: Old .html URLs still show
**Solution:**
- This is normal (backward compatibility)
- Users will gradually use clean URLs
- Search engines will index clean URLs over time

### Problem: Navigation broken
**Solution:**
- Check `js/utils.js` → `getPagePath()` function
- Verify JavaScript console for errors
- Test both `.html` and clean URL versions
