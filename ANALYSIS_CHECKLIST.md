## 📊 Quick Facts (From Analysis)

### Code Size
- **Current:** 7,529 lines in 6 HTML files
- **After:** ~8,590 lines in 20 organized files
- **Duplication:** 60% before → 0% after

### Files to Create
- **CSS:** 9 files (global + page-specific)
- **JS:** 11 files (shared + page-specific)
- **HTML:** 6 refactored (structure only)
- **New:** login.html, supabase-client.js

### Folder Structure
```
css/      → 9 style files (shared + unique)
js/       → 11 logic files (shared + unique)
pages/    → 6 minimal HTML files
lib/      → Production utilities
docs/     → Complete documentation
```

### Duplication Breakdown
| Category | Duplication | Impact |
|----------|------------|--------|
| CSS Variables | 100% | 450 lines wasted × 6 |
| Layout Styles | 95% | 250 lines wasted × 6 |
| Translations | 100% | 600 lines wasted × 6 |
| Utilities | 100% | 80 lines wasted × 6 |
| Navigation | 90% | 150 lines wasted × 6 |
| **TOTAL** | **~60%** | **~1,530 lines duplicated** |

## 🚀 Three Implementation Options

### Option A: Full Extraction (Recommended)
**Follow:** EXTRACTION_ROADMAP.md exactly  
**Time:** 8-10 hours  
**Benefit:** Perfect organization, 0% duplication  
**Risk:** Long refactoring session  
**Best for:** Fresh start, dedicated time available  

### Option B: Phased Extraction (Balanced)
**Steps:**
1. Extract Phase 1 (CSS only) - 2 hours
2. Test all pages
3. Extract Phase 2 (Shared JS) - 2 hours
4. Test all pages
5. Extract Phase 3 (Page JS) - 3-4 hours
6. Extract Phase 4 (Cleanup) - 1.5 hours

**Time:** 8-10 hours (spread over 2-3 days)  
**Benefit:** Can stop between phases, less risky  
**Risk:** None - each phase is independent  
**Best for:** Limited time, want to test along the way  

### Option C: Gradual Extraction (Pragmatic)
**Approach:** Extract only what's needed for next feature  
1. Extract CSS when adding new page
2. Extract JS when refactoring functionality
3. Add to docs as you go

**Time:** Ongoing (1-2 hours per feature)  
**Benefit:** No big refactoring, fits into workflow  
**Risk:** May never be fully refactored  
**Best for:** Active development, can't stop for refactoring
